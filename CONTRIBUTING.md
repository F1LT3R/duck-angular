Contributing to Duck Angular
============================

This guide will assume a developer wants to contribute to Duck Angular, and that is working on an environment that is absolutely a blank slate. 

Requirements:

 - NPM
 - git
 - Karma

Install Duck Angular:

 - Clone the repository
 - Using npm, install Duck's dev dependencies with `npm install`
 - Run the test suite by running `karma start`

Now you have the tests installed and running, and can make changes.
